# cockroach_utils
A (very) unorganized, loose collection of utilities and tools, mostly in 
Python, for working on/in [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach).

# Requirements

- Python 3

# Tools

- `cockroach.keys` - a loose, limited port of `pkg/keys` in CockroachDB. For 
  use in quick key conversions.
- `cockroach.utils.goroutine_parser` - a tool for sifting through goroutine 
  dumps and grouping running goroutines in a process.

# Notes

More to come...
